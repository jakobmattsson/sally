### Auth

Three levels of auth:
* read
* write
* create

If no auth-function is written, anyone is allowed to do every operation (even anonymous users)
If an "auth" function is created, that one will be used as basis for all three level.
If an "authWrite" function is created, that one will be used for write and create.
If an "authCreate" function is created, that one will be used to authorize create-actions.

All the auth functions recieves a user as input parameter and returns an object describing the access level.
It should be interpreted like this:
* null means: you must authorize yourself
* {} means: you are allowed access to every object in the collection
* any other object means: you are allowed access to those objects matching the given object
